# Problem 2

*For binary outcome data, the median almost certainly equals 0 or 1.*

# Example:

Let $D$ be a Bernoulli distribution with parameter, $p$. Consider any finite
sample, $(x_1, \ldots, x_n)$, of $n$ IID draws from $D$. Suppose that we
calculate the median of this sample.

If $n$ is odd, the median is always a specific draw from this
distribution, which is either 0 or 1.

If $n$ is even, the median is either 0, 0.5, or 1. Importantly, the median is
only equal to 0.5 if the number of 0's and 1's in the data is exactly balanced.
This is fairly rare event, especially as $p$ gets further from 0.5.
