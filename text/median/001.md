# Problem 1

*The sampling distribution of the median can be multimodal if the source
distribution is mulitmodal.*

# Example:

Let $D$ be a distribution defined as a 50/50 mixture of two normals. As a
specific example, we will assume that $D$ is a mixture of two normals:
$\mathcal{N}(-10, 1)$ and $\mathcal{N}(+10, 1)$. The PDF for this distribution
is shown in Figure **median/001/001**:

  Distribution](/Users/johnmyleswhite/Counterexamples/images/median/001/001.pdf)

For this bimodal source distribution, $D$, the sampling distribution is not
close to being normally distributed, because the median is most likely to be
defined by either two points from the first mixture component or by two points
from the second mixture component. This can be seen in the simulation results
shown below:

  Median](/Users/johnmyleswhite/Counterexamples/images/median/001/002.pdf)

In this case, the contrast between the erratic behavior of the sample mean
and the sample median is very stark. As predicted by the Central Limit Theorem,
the sampling distribution of the mean is approximately normal:

  Mean](/Users/johnmyleswhite/Counterexamples/images/median/001/003.pdf)

In the table below, we show the estimated standard deviations of the sampling
distributions of the sample median and sample mean for this case. The median
is roughly 20x more variable:

|--------------------------------|------------------------------|
| **Std. Dev. of Sample Median** | **Std. Dev. of Sample Mean** |
| 2.918197                       | 0.1612805                    |
