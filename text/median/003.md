# Problem 3

*The median is not a function of all parameters of the data generating
 process.*

# Example 3:

Consider the following mixture model:

* We draw 99 values from a uniform distribution over the interval $[0, 1]$.
* We draw 1 value from a right-shifted exponential, defined as
  $y \sim X + 10$, where $X$ is an exponential distribution with mean $t$.

In this case, the sample distribution of the median is independent of $t$.

Consider the contrast between the sampling distributions of the median and the
mean for two source distributions: one with $t = 1$ and another with
$t = 1000$.
